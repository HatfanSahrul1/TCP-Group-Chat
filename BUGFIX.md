# Fix Log - NullReferenceException

## Problem
```
System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
at tcp_group_chat.ChatForm.ListContacts_SelectedIndexChanged(Object sender, EventArgs e) 
in C:\Users\THINKPAD\dotnet_kuliah\tcp-group-chat\ChatForm.cs:line 231
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because `networkClient` was null when `ListContacts_SelectedIndexChanged` was called during form initialization. This happened because:

1. In `InitializeComponent()`, we set `listContacts.SelectedIndex = 0` 
2. This triggered `ListContacts_SelectedIndexChanged` event
3. But `networkClient` was not yet initialized (it's created after `InitializeComponent()`)
4. The code tried to access `networkClient.IsConnected` causing NullReferenceException

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Null Check
```csharp
// Before
if (listContacts.SelectedItem != null && networkClient.IsConnected)

// After  
if (listContacts.SelectedItem != null && networkClient != null && networkClient.IsConnected)
```

### 2. Moved Auto-Selection After NetworkClient Initialization
```csharp
// Before: In InitializeComponent()
listContacts.SelectedIndex = 0; // Auto-select group chat

// After: In Constructor after networkClient is created
// Initialize network client
networkClient = new NetworkClient();
networkClient.MessageReceived += OnMessageReceived;
networkClient.ConnectionStateChanged += OnConnectionStateChanged;
networkClient.ErrorOccurred += OnErrorOccurred;

// Auto-select group chat after networkClient is initialized
listContacts.SelectedIndex = 0;
```

### 3. Updated Comment in InitializeComponent
```csharp
// Auto-select will be done after networkClient is initialized
```

## Result
- ✅ NullReferenceException fixed
- ✅ Application now starts without crashes
- ✅ Auto-selection still works but happens at the right time
- ✅ All functionality preserved

## Testing Files Created
